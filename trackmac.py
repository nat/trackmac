# Run this script in a terminal. It displays activity statistics 
# from the last 24 hours, like this:
#
# 1h 8m57s  70%  Google Chrome
#   14m17s  14%  Mail
#    8m11s   8%  iChat
#    3m16s   3%  Colloquy
#    1m28s   1%  1Password
#      43s   0%  Terminal
#      12s   0%  TextMate
#       4s   0%  Finder
#       4s   0%  SecurityAgent
#
# 1h37m12s Sitting at the computer
# 3h37m16s Doing something else
# 5h14m28s Total
# 
# It detects idle time based on the screensaver, so lower your 
# screensaver delay to improve accuracy.
#
# It doesn't save the data, so if you kill the script it loses the
# history. You might want to kill it every day or so, so it doesn't
# get too big (it keeps all the old samples around).
